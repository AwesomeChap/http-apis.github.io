## Requirements

The system is built over the following standards and tools:
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) a Python based micro-framework for handling server requests and responses.
- [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) as the preferred data format.
- [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/) as the API standard.
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the backend database connector for storage and related operations.

Apart from this, there are also various Python packages that Hydrus uses. Using `python setup.py install` installs all the required dependencies.

**NOTE:** You'll need to use `python3` not `python2`.
