# Prerequisite Knowledge

Below some information is listed, which is important to be known. If you know them already, feel free to skip this section. Here we go!

* **Semantic Web :** _The Semantic Web is a mesh of interconnected data that are associated in such a way that they can easily be processed by machines instead of human operators_. It can be conceived as an extended version of the existing World Wide Web, and it represents an effective means of data representation in the form of a globally linked database. By supporting the inclusion of semantic content in Web pages, the Semantic Web targets the conversion of the presently available Web of unstructured documents to a Web of information/data.

* **RDF and Linked Data :** Hydra is an extension of W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is widely known as the technology which makes the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) possible by representing data as [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data).
[RDF is a W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) that allows the representation of Knowledge in specific Domain as Knowledge Graphs. Quanta of information are represented as "triples": statements that relate a subject to an object by a predicate. Triples can be stored in different formats. The format used in Hydra and hydrus is [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/).
For a more detailed explanation of triples, you can [read this document](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/linked-data-fragments/#interfaces-to-linked-data).

* **JSON-LD :** _JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data), is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON._ It was a goal to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing JSON to JSON-LD. You may find more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD). 

* **Next-Gen APIs :** Modified version of APIs (currently in use which are not understandable by computers) whose data can be interpreted by computers.

* **Hypermedia-Driven Web APIs :** A rest API that contains links, You can navigate by clicking on these links just like you do in a web browser. 

* **Schema.org :** Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, email messages, and beyond.
Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.

Now that you have some basic knowledge about terms shown above, You can move ahead to <a href="/Hydra">next</a> section
